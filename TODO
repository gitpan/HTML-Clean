TODO list for the HTML::Clean Module
------------------------------------

* May need to be more selective with some of the regexps, so as to not
  clobber JavaScript.

* Add a real parser/grammar system, like a real compiler, then we
  can optimize repeated HTML elements, like this:

  <center>sometext</center><center>some more text</center>

* Replace <div align="center"></div> with just <center></center>

* Rename all tags to lowercase, see if it helps when sending data over 
  a compressed PPP line.

* Add counters so we can collect statistics on the usefullness of 
  the various optimizations
